# Text_To_Speech_Convertor
I developed this project which uses input text and converts them into speech sounds. 

Text to speech (TTS) is a technology that enables text to be converted into speech sounds. In this project, you can convert your text into speech on  different voices. Text-to-speech (TTS) convention  transforms linguistic information stored as data  or text into speech. Speech synthesis is the  artificial production of human speech.

The objective of text to speech technology is to ease and bridge the communication gap between people speaking different languages. With globalization, people travel from one place to another for work and travel purposes, they might not be fluent in speaking the language in different areas or countries so with the help of this technology people can speak in their native language and can get it translated according to the country in which they are in.

For people with visual impairment, text to speech can be a very useful tool as well. For those who access content on mobile devices, reading a great deal of content on a small screen is not always easy. Having text-to-speech software doing the work is much easier. It allows people to get the information they want without the inconvenience of a lot of scrolling.
 
Speech Synthesis is the methodology used in this project. 

Speech synthesis is accessed via the SpeechSynthesis interface, a text-to-speech component that allows programs to read out their text content (normally via the device's default speech synthesizer.)  Different voice types are represented by SpeechSynthesisVoice objects, and different parts of text that you want to be spoken are represented by SpeechSynthesisUtterance objects.

You can get these spoken by passing them to the SpeechSynthesis.speak() method. The Web Speech API enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech), and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.)
